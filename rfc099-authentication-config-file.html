<h1>Authentication Configuration</h1>

<p>Currently, the Chef community maintains many tools to aid in the
management and switching of Chef Server configuration options - for
example <code>knife-block</code>. Any non-ruby tools must also implement their own
configuration management, since our configuration files must be parsed
as though they were ruby.</p>

<p>It would be delightful to provide a single configuration file that was
solely responsible for handling authentication options, and was in a
language agnostic format, such as TOML.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As an Operations Engineer,
I want to manage nodes on many Chef Servers,
so that I can interact with my whole estate.

As a tool developer,
I want to use the language of my choice,
so that I can effectively build delightful Chef features.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>A new file, <code>~/.chef/credentials</code>, will be supported by the chef client
libraries, and other implementations. It is a TOML file, containing one
or more sections, each associated with a profile.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[default]</span>
<span class="na">node_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;barney&quot;</span>
<span class="na">client_key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;barney_rubble.pem&quot;</span>
<span class="na">chef_server_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;https://api.chef.io/organisations/bedrock&quot;</span>

<span class="k">[dev]</span>
<span class="na">client_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;admin&quot;</span>
<span class="na">client_key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;admin.pem&quot;</span>
<span class="na">validator_key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;test-validator.pem&quot;</span>
<span class="na">chef_server_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;https://api.chef-server.dev/organizations/test&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>File paths, such as <code>client_key</code> or <code>validator_key</code>, will be relative to
<code>~/.chef</code> unless absolute.</p>

<p>Clients can be identified with either <code>node_name</code> or <code>client_name</code>, with
<code>client_name</code> being preferred.</p>

<p>Keys can be specified inline using TOML multiline strings.</p>

<p>The profile is selected using the <code>CHEF_PROFILE</code> environment variable, which
client libraries which implement credential handling MUST support.
Optionally, tools can also provide a <code>--profile</code> option, which would
override the environment variable.</p>

<p>To allow the user to specify statefully which profile they wish to
use, we will introduce another new file, <code>~/.chef/context</code>, which would
contain only the name of the profile to be used.</p>

<p>It is expected that the credentials file will be parsed first, allowing
the user&#39;s <code>knife.rb</code>/<code>config.rb</code> to continue to function as previously.</p>

<p>To select the profile to use, libraries should follow the following
order:</p>

<ol>
<li>If an argument is passed with a command line flag, use that.</li>
<li>Otherwise, check for the <code>CHEF_PROFILE</code> environment variable, and
use the value of that.</li>
<li>Otherwise, check for the context file, and read the profile name
from that.</li>
<li>Otherwise, select the default profile.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Downstream Impact</h2>

<p>Any chef API client library (such as <code>pychef</code>, <code>go-chef</code>,
<code>rs-chef-api</code>), as well as <code>chef-config</code>, should be updated
to support this file. </p>

<p>Manage should be updated to produce a credentials file when generating a
knife config.</p>
