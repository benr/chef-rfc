<h1>Supermarket Release Channels</h1>

<p>Add the ability to assign supermarket artifacts (cookbook versions) to a named
channel, and to filter the universe endpoint data by specifying a channel name.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a Supermarket User,
I want to promote my artifacts through named channels,
so that I can release them according to my testing and release policy.
</pre></div>
<p>Many users implement a testing pipeline to automate testing and release of chef
artifacts. An example of this kind of system is the workflow component of the
Chef Automate product. Frequently it is necessary or convenient to publish an
artifact to a Supermarket service at an early pipeline stage, so that the
artifact can be distributed to other systems for testing. For example, when
using Chef Automate, the default behavior is to publish the artifact in the
build phase, so that it may be retrieved by other systems during acceptance
testing. In the current implementation, publishing the artifact makes it
available to all users of the Supermarket service. For example, a berkshelf
user developing a cookbook may retrieve this artifact when installing
dependencies. This is undesirable because the artifact has not yet passed
acceptance testing and therefore may contain flaws. Additionally, in the case
of Chef Automate, there is a manual release gate that occurs later in the
pipeline; it would be preferable that users only access artifacts that have
passed this gate.</p>

<p>In other artifact storage systems, artifacts may be assigned to channels and
promoted as they pass automated or manual verification. For example, each Chef
Client build is initially created in an &quot;unstable&quot; channel for distribution to
automated testing systems. If the package passes automated testing, it is
promoted to the &quot;current&quot; channel where users may access it.</p>

<p>Adding release channels gives Supermarket users this same ability to control
the release process for their Chef artifacts.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<h4>Creation of Channels</h4>

<p>Supermarket administrators set the list of valid channel names via
configuration. Artifacts may not be created in or promoted to channel names
that are not in the approved list. The implementation may allow existing
artifact-channel associations to exist when a channel is removed from the
approved list.</p>

<p>The implementation will specify a default set of approved channels if the
administrator does not specify the approved channel set.</p>

<h4>Association of Artifacts to Channels</h4>

<p>Artifacts may belong to an arbitrary number of channels. We expect that in the
case of Chef Automate, users will want artifacts to remain available in the
union channel even after promoting that artifact to rehearsal.</p>

<p>Supermarket administrators may set a default channel to be associated to new
artifacts. If the administrator does not set a default channel, the
implementation will specify a default.</p>

<h4>Artifact Versions and Channels</h4>

<p>Channels may have any number of versions of an artifact, so that old versions
remain available after a newer version is promoted to that channel.</p>

<p>There are some use cases where it is desirable to only allow one version of an
artifact in a channel. Users of Chef Automate, for example, are encouraged to
only use one version of an artifact in a given environment. Therefore, the
user may specify that an artifact is <em>exclusive.</em> When this option
is active, promoting a version of an artifact to a channel removes all other
versions from that channel. The exact mechanism by which this happens, e.g.,
configuration or API call, will be determined when implemented.</p>

<h4>Filtering Artifacts by Channel</h4>

<p>Filtering is implemented by modifying the response from the <code>/universe</code>
endpoint to include only the artifacts in the requested channel.</p>

<p>The API will be extended to allow requests to specify a channel when requesting
the universe data. The exact details of this implementation will be decided in
the future, with special consideration given to compatibility with existing
consumers of the universe data.</p>

<p>Supermarket administrators may set a default channel to be used for requests
that do not specify a channel. The implementation will specify a default to be
used if the administrator does not specify one.</p>

<h4>Configuration and Backwards Compatibility</h4>

<p>For compatibility, there must be a mode of operation where Supermarket works
the same as it does now. This is achieved by a combination of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Upon upgrade, all artifacts are associated to a default channel.</li>
<li>The implementation specifies a default channel for new artifacts that is the
same as in (1).</li>
<li>The implementation specifies a default channel for requests for the universe
data that is the same as (1)</li>
<li>The implementation specifies the default set of allowed channel names to a
list containing only the default channel in (1).</li>
</ol>

<p>Together, these factors provide the following outcomes:</p>

<ul>
<li>All cookbooks are associated to the same single channel</li>
<li>Requests for the universe data are de facto unfiltered, because all artifacts
are associated to the one channel that exists</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus the existing behavior is maintained.</p>

<h4>Web User Interface Considerations</h4>

<p>Decisions about changes to Supermarket&#39;s web interface will be left to
implementers to decide. One goal should be to give the user an understanding of
what version of a cookbook will be available to them for a given channel
configuration on their client (e.g., berks).</p>

<h2>Downstream Impact</h2>

<p>Tools that use the <code>/universe</code> endpoint will function correctly unmodified.
However, these tools will need to be modified to allow the user to select the
desired channel in order for users to be able to use the channel functionality.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether this feature would be useful for the public supermarket.
One way to deal with this is to have a feature flag to disable the
functionality and leave it disabled on the public supermarket.</p>
