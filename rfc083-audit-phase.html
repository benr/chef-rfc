<h1>Audit Segment</h1>

<p>Support audit and compliance checks in a technology agnostic way.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a cookbook author,
I want to ship custom controls,
so that I can ensure my nodes are compliant.

As a cookbook author,
I want to use the most suitable compliance library,
so that I can write controls effectively.

As an operator,
I want to ensure that my converge happens separately from my audit,
so that I have full control over my runs.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>As per RFC-35, audits will be run in the <code>audit</code> phase, which occurs
after the <code>converge</code> phase completes.</p>

<p>An audit handler will be introduced to allow cookbooks to register for
the audit phase.</p>

<p>The current, Serverspec based audit mode will be migrated to a cookbook
and removed from the chef-client.</p>

<p>A cookbook may depend on other gems in the usual manner to provide
functionality to audit tests.</p>

<p>Tools will be updated to upload the <code>tests</code> directory to both
supermarket and chef server. Audits can then be used both at development
time with test kitchen and similar tools, and with audit mode.</p>
