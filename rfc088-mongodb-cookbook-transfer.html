<h1>Transfer mongodb cookbook on Supermarket to Sous Chefs org</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a user of the mongodb cookbook,
I want to have the cookbook maintained and released to Supermarket,
so that I can get cookbook updates for non-EOS versions of MongoDB.

As a user of the mongodb cookbook,
I want to have the cookbook up to date on Supermarket,
so that I can install a version of MongoDB that is getting security updates.

As a Sous Chef member,
I want to be able to release to Supermarket,
so that the community at large can consume the maintained fork.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Currently the <a href="https://github.com/edelight/chef-mongodb">mongodb cookbook</a>
on <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/mongodb">Supermarket</a> was last released
on November 11, 2014.  The last commit on the GitHub repository was the day prior,
November 10, 2014.  At the time of the writing of this draft, the repository has
70 open issues and 35 open PRs.  The last comment on any issue or PR by any
maintainer was by <a href="https://github.com/edelight/chef-mongodb/pull/356">jamesonjlee</a>
on December 9, 2014.</p>

<p>The Sous Chefs have been maintaining a <a href="https://github.com/sous-chefs/mongodb">fork</a>
of the mongodb cookbook.  The fork&#39;s master branch is currently 90 commits ahead
of the source repository for the cookbook. The Sous Chefs have been active on the issues
on the original repository and have worked to fix them in the maintained fork.</p>

<p>Grant Ridder, on behalf of the Sous Chefs, has attempted on several occasions during
November and December of 2016 to contact Markus Korn, the current owner on Supermarket,
as well as Jameson Lee, a contributor on Supermarket and last committer on GitHub.
Both individuals were each contacted with 2 different methods without response.  At the
time of the writing of this draft, the last evidence of activity for either user, in the
context of the mongodb cookbook, is more than 2 years ago.</p>

<p>The Sous Chefs would therefor request that the MongoDB cookbook on Supermarket be
marked deprecated in favor of <a href="https://github.com/sous-chefs/mongodb">sc-mongodb</a>
on Supermarket under provisions layed out in the <code>When a Cookbook is NOT Up For Adoption</code>
section of <a href="https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc069-cookbook-adoption.md">RFC069</a>.</p>

<h3>Deprecation Process for this RFC</h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nathenharvey">@nathenharvey</a> will reach out to
<a href="https://github.com/thekorn">@thekorn</a> weekly asking for a decision on
the ownership of the cookbook.</li>
<li>The Sous Chefs will publish their MongoDB cookbook to the Supermarket.</li>
<li>On, or after, March 15, 2017 (3 months after this RFC was submitted),
a Supermarket Administrator will mark the current MongoDB cookbook
as deprecated and offer the Sous Chefs&#39; cookbook as a suitable replacement.</li>
<li>A message will be posted to the mailing list notifying of this change and our reasoning behind it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: As the current owner of the cookbook, <a href="https://github.com/thekorn">@thekorn</a> can
accelerate or stop this timeline at any time.</p>

<h2>Downstream Impact</h2>

<p>Since the Sous Chef&#39;s fork is compatible with the existing cookbook on Supermarket,
no downstream impact is expected.</p>
