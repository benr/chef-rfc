<h1>Anonymous user behaviour data collection</h1>

<p>In order to provide greater insight into how our Chef users interact with Chef
tools, this RFC introduces a framework for defining the policies for the
anonymous collection (sharing), storage, and deletion of product usage data
that can be applied to any Chef project.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>This RFC only covers Chef&#39;s open source ecosystem. It does not apply to proprietary,
commercially available tools made by Chef Software.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As a UX designer at Chef,
I want to understand how people use Chef tools,
so that I can improve their experience.

As a product owner at Chef,
I want to learn which Chef tools and commands are most used,
so I can prioritise development.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>This RFC defines the core of product usage data sharing. It does not define how
individual apps will implement product usage data sharing; any app that
wishes to do so MUST create a follow up RFC that details individual behaviour,
and the types of data that will be shared with Chef Software.</p>

<h3>Sharing by default</h3>

<p>In order to gather meaningful data, Chef tools will share anonymized usage data
by default. Experience (with Habitat and Automate) has shown that disabling
sharing by default provides sample sets that are too small (and potentially
biased) to draw meaningful conclusions.  The Chef tools must provide clear
information so that users always know how to easily change their data sharing
preference. Once set, any data sharing preference saved on an individual host
will be honored by all Chef tools run on that host.</p>

<p>On the first run of a telemetry enabled tool, the tool MUST prompt the
user if a decision about whether to participate has not been made. That
decision will be recorded for future use. If the tool is unable to prompt
(because of a lack of terminal, for example), no decision will be recorded,
and the library will select a reasonable default.</p>

<p>We will implement a noun in the Chef DK, <code>chef telemetry</code>, that will
allow users to check their opt out status and easily opt out, for
instance with <code>chef telemetry status</code> and <code>chef telemetry disable</code>,
respectively.</p>

<p>A user may opt-out globally by touching <code>~/.chef/telemetry_opt_out</code> or
by using the above command, or may do so in a repository or working tree
specific way by touching <code>.chef/telemetry_opt_out</code>, which will be
searched for by tools in the same way as for chef config.</p>

<p>A user may also set the environment variable <code>CHEF_TELEMETRY_OPT_OUT</code> to
opt out.</p>

<p>Server tools may each require their own separate data sharing preference.</p>

<p>The Chef Client will never collect or share telemetry.</p>

<h3>High-Level Implementation</h3>

<p>All Chef tools will use a centralized configuration for product usage data
sharing, in order to provide a consistent experience. If the configuration is
not present, a data-sharing-enabled application will create a well-formatted
configuration file. Upon creating the configuration file, the tool will notify
the user that product usage data sharing is enabled, and will provide clear
information so that users always knowhow to easily change their data sharing
preference.</p>

<p>Tools should provide a command that allows a user to see and understand
what data the tool is collecting and reporting.</p>

<p>All product usage data sharing enabled applications will provide simple ways
for a user to check their data sharing preference, and to change that
preference.</p>

<h3>Client Library Implementation</h3>

<p>Since most Chef client applications are ruby based, a common gem will be
produced to deliver telemetry data to the receivers.</p>

<p>The gem will handle:
  * sessions - decision on when to create a new session, rolling session
  keys
  * retries - delivery of events will be retried, with exponential back
  off, a number of times before telemetry delivery is disabled for the
  duration of the process.
  * opt out - checking and setting of user opt out status.
  * (in the future) storing and forwarding of events - if a process would complete before any events
  are sent, the library MAY be responsible for storing the events, and
  resending any further events at a suitable time in the future. Fresh
  events will be prioritised over older ones. For v1, it is acceptable
  to just throw away events that we couldn&#39;t send.</p>

<p>To avoid blocking the application, the entire library will be built to
use asynchronous operations, using the Concurrent Ruby library.</p>

<p>Session management will be provided to ensure that we protect user&#39;s
privacy by sending anonymous events, but also to allow developers to
understand all the steps of an interaction. The library will ensure that
a session ID times out after 10 minutes of inactivity, whilst providing
the same ID to all clients used during the same time period.</p>

<p>Events are sent using HTTP POST requests to Chef&#39;s telemetry end point. </p>

<h3>Privacy and Data Retention</h3>

<p>To provide user privacy and protect from de-anonymization attacks while still
gathering data that is useful for understanding our tools, Chef tools
will choose a new UUID for each new user session.</p>

<p>To ensure that sensitive data is not collected, Chef tools should never
collect parameters passed to command-line options, and tools will be able to
filter more aggressively if required.</p>

<p>For example, knife may report that a <code>-P</code> option was invoked, but will never
collect the password parameter that was passed to that option.</p>

<p>Chef is committed to protecting user privacy and as product usage data is
shared with Chef, it must be stored with protection from de-anonymization
attacks in mind. All product usage data must be anonymized, and must not
share personally identifiable information with Chef.</p>

<p>All data storage must be compliant with EU privacy law.</p>

<p>All collected data will be subject to Chef&#39;s <a href="https://www.chef.io/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>,
which is Privacy Shield certified. Any collected data will be deleted upon
request.</p>

<h3>Access to data</h3>

<p>So that all developers can make use of the gathered data set, Chef will make
available query mechanisms in a way that&#39;s compliant with our Privacy
Policy and our responsibilities under the GDPR and similar legislation.</p>

<h3>Prior Art</h3>

<p>Many open source projects collect data from their users to help allocate
resources. 
* Both <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport">Ubuntu</a> and
<a href="https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> collect crash dumps from their
users, along with system information, to help developers better debug and
improve their systems. 
* The Debian project runs <a href="https://popcon.debian.org/">PopCon</a> to better
understand what packages are installed and which architectures are in
use.
* Habitat, our sister project, collects <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/docs/about-analytics/">analytics</a>
related to user interactions.
* Mac Homebrew collects user behavior <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Analytics.md">analytics</a>.
* .NET Core CLI collects user behaviour <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/07/21/what-weve-learned-from-net-core-sdk-telemetry/">analytics</a></p>

<h3>Types of collected data</h3>

<p>Some data we envisage collecting includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Community Cookbooks used, and versions (in policyfiles or berkshelf)</li>
<li>Kitchen plugins</li>
<li>Vagrant boxes</li>
<li>Commands and options attempted</li>
<li>Versions of chef and other tools used</li>
</ul>
