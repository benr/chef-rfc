<h1>Disable the Passwd and Sessions Ohai plugins</h1>

<p>We get a large number of user reports that these two plugins can cause a
huge amount of unwanted storage use, especially in large enterprises
with nodes hooked up to an AD tree. We should disable them by default
in Chef 14, and provide appropriate notifications.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As an Operations Engineer,
I want to run my Chef Server efficiently,
so that I can concentrate on providing value to my employers.
</pre></div>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>By default, make the <code>passwd</code> and <code>sessions</code> plugins disabled by
default.</p>

<h2>Downstream Impact</h2>

<p>Any cookbooks that require these plugins will need to ensure that they
document this, and operators will need to re-enable them.</p>
